# AGENTS.md

This project is a metaphor sketch generated from the `2d` template.
metaphor is built for AI-assisted creative coding: you can **observe the running
sketch, edit, and re-observe** in a tight loop. Read this file first.

## The development loop (observe → edit → verify)

1. The human starts a live session once: `metaphor watch --viewer`
   (a window opens; the sketch rebuilds on every file save).
2. You (the AI) work through the **`metaphor` MCP server**:
   - `snapshot` — capture the current frame as PNG + internal state
     (`frame.json`: frameCount / time / `probe()` values / blank warnings).
   - `build_status` — did the latest `swift build` succeed? Check this after every edit.
   - `api_reference` — read the metaphor API docs (see below). Use before new APIs.
   - `input` — send mouse/keyboard events to the running sketch (standalone mode only).
3. Edit `Sources/Sketch0718Hello/App.swift`, then `build_status`, then `snapshot`.
   Repeat. If a snapshot looks stale, `build_status` tells you whether your edit compiled.

## MCP setup

`.mcp.json` is committed in this project, so Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code
auto-connect to the `metaphor` MCP server — no setup needed.

For other clients, register once:

```bash
claude mcp add metaphor -- metaphor mcp .
```

> Start `metaphor watch` **before** opening your AI client, so the MCP server
> attaches to the live viewer session instead of spawning its own headless instance.

## API reference

Prefer the **`api_reference` MCP tool** — it always reads the docs of the exact
metaphor version this project depends on:

- `api_reference doc=sketch` — compact sketch-authoring guide (start here).
- `api_reference doc=full` — full generated API reference (use `grep` to narrow).
- `api_reference doc=examples` — index of nearby examples to copy patterns from.

Fallback (if MCP is unavailable): read these files directly from the metaphor
library at `.build/checkouts/metaphor`:

- `.build/checkouts/metaphor/llms-sketch.txt`
- `.build/checkouts/metaphor/llms.txt`
- `.build/checkouts/metaphor/docs/ai/examples-index.md`

(For a release-pinned dependency this path appears once dependencies are
resolved; `metaphor new` resolves them for you, or run `swift package resolve`.)

## Run commands

```bash
metaphor run            # build and launch once
metaphor watch --viewer # live-reload window for the observe→edit loop
swift run               # plain SwiftPM run
```

Use `metaphor doctor` if the sketch does not build or launch.

- Creative brief: `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

## Observing internal state with probe()

Call `probe("name", value)` inside `draw()` to surface a value to the AI. It shows
up in `snapshot`'s `frame.json` (and is a no-op when no probe is active, so it is
safe to leave in). Use it to make state you care about observable, e.g.:

```swift
probe("particles.count", particles.count)
probe("mouse", [mouseX, mouseY])
```

Probe is enabled automatically under `metaphor watch` and `metaphor mcp`.

## AI coding guidance

- Prefer `import metaphor` and Processing-style sketch APIs before reaching for lower-level modules.
- Confirm an API with `api_reference` before inventing helpers; copy from `doc=examples`.
- Keep `setup()` for initialization, loading assets, configuring cameras, and allocating reusable resources.
- Keep `draw()` frame-safe: avoid repeated disk I/O, heavy allocation, or blocking work.
- When changing visuals, preserve the sketch's stated intent in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.
- If a build fails, fix the first compiler error before making broad rewrites (`build_status` shows it).
